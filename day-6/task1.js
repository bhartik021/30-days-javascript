/*
1/4 Object Literals

Explanation: Objects in JavaScript are used to store collections of data and more complex entities. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.

Syntax:
let objectName = {
  property1: value1,
  property2: value2,
  // ...
};
*/


let person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30
};
console.log(person);
